Pretty much updated for competitive. Most of the elements VALVe added are added into the files necessary.

Known Bugs:

When ran in a lower resolution (usually anything below 1920x1080) the font gets incredibly huge
ItemModelPanel background does not show up in Class loadout, works fine in backpack for some reason
Some fonts are huge, (Vote hud, Catalog description) I don't know what font controls these but I must have made them huge on accident.
Competitive door animation at the start of a matchmaking round doesn't display. Other elemnts of matchmaking hud work fine.
