mkHUD - It's not done
=======
There are a lot of bugs within this hud. Please comment on my profile if you happen to run into any issues using this HUD.

Resolution Support
----------
16:9 - Made on 1920x1080 resolution. Should work fine on other resolutions. There may be slight offsets with other resolutions, however.

16:10 - Not sure

5:6 - Not sure

4:3 - Kind of. Most elements on the right side of the screen get cut off.


This version of my hud is quite far behind. I will update everything when I know everything is how I want it to be. Expect a full release near the end of this month / early June. Even then, I don't expect everything to be bug-free, so please, let me know what bugs there are.

Fonts
------------
If your fonts aren't working, go to mkHUD/resource/fonts, select all > right click > Install. Restart TF2 and you should be able to see the fonts.
