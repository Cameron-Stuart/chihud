A hud for Team Fortress 2.

Constructive criticism is always welcome. Please let me know what I can do fit what other people want. And please tell me what I can do to improve the readability, etc.

http://steamcommunity.com/id/nimtra is my profile URL if you would like to report bugs or give me feedback. 

This HUD is very reliant on VTF files. There are a couple VTF files that are quite large in size, specifically the background of the loadout panels, main menu, and class images. I do not recommend running this HUD on a potato. You may get 10x more lag if you run this HUD on a potato.

Notes
------------

I recently updated this HUD to use Roboto instead of Product Sans. If you still prefer Product Sans, you can swap between them. How to do that is explained in the first image of my Screenshot album. Though the HUD may not look as good with Product Sans because Product Sans does not have different weights, the option is still available if you really would like it.

I would appreciate it if you didn't redistribute this hud as yours. Please give me credit if you happen to release an edit of this hud.

Crosshair
--------------
The custom crosshair is manageable through HudPlayerClass.res. I made it like this so when you are dead/in scoreboard/freezecam the crosshair doesn't show up, where as if I put it in hudlayout.res it would show up all the time.

Resolution Support
----------
16:9 - Yes. Looks the best on 1920x1080. There are some offsets in other resolutions, unfortunately. But they aren't very noticeable.

16:10 - Yes. Everything should work for the most part. There are some offsets in other resolutions, unfortunately. But they aren't very noticeable.

4:3 - As of right now, no. I will work on supporting 4:3 soon.

To-Do
---------

Finish MVM hud

Finish competitive menu and mvm menu

Despite these, the hud is 100% usable, and there are no bugs AFAIK.

Make symbols for report and mute

Do what Wiethoofd did and make it so the HUD updates almost effortlessly using #base

The reason I made my own HUD is because I liked so many different HUDs, I had no idea which one to use. Because I had a hard time deciding, why not just think of everything I like and make them into one HUD? So most of the things I have credited here is because 1) you have a cool HUD or 2) you helped out a lot :) 3)

<b>BroeselHUD (feeling and broesel)</b> - Lots of inspiration. I borrowed some elements from the hud as well. This was the hud I used for a very long time until I figured out how to edit huds.

<b>ahud (Nokk)</b> - Again, a lot of the stuff I put into my hud was inspired by Nokk's hud. An amazing hud. He also answered a lot of my questions, and I greatly appreciate the help. After I got bored of BroeselHUD, I used ahud. It's a great hud.

<b>Rawrsor</b> - A lot of the elements in my hud were inspired by his. The material dropshadows, etc. I used some of his materials as well. He answered the questions I had about hud editing as well. :)

<b>cbhud (CoBa)</b> - It sucks that he hasn't updated it, but still a great hud. Some elements in my hud were inspired by this hud.

<b>rayshud (raysfire)</b> - An amazing streamer and maker of a very well crafted hud. His tutorials helped me out a ton, and I highly recommend you check out his stream. http://twitch.tv/raysfire/ :) I borrowed his SpectatorTournament.res to use with my hud as well. Hope you don't mind, Rays!

<b>wavesui (extracrispy)</b> - Though I started creating my hud before this hud was posted to TF.TV, I did get quite a bit of inspiration from him when he posted in the hud mod thread on tf.tv. The colour scheme of my hud was not intentionally made to be so close to wavesui, it was a complete coincidence. I was using a colour scheme generator- specifically this one: https://coolors.co/app/2b303a-92dce5-ededed-7c7c7c-d64933 - After using wavesui for a short amount of time, I can say that he has put a shit ton of work into it, and it's very VERY well made. I kinda wish my HUD didn't have the dark blue top border with the light blue text on it, because now it looks like I am copying him. But anyway, you should check wavesui out. His hud is so good. I implemented his font swapper into my HUD. Hopefully you are okay with this, extracrispy.

<b>ToonHUD (Griever)</b> - I borrowed the SourceScheme.res from his hud. I hope you are alright with this. A very well made hud. Again, some elements in my hud were inspired by his.

<b>ompHUD (omp)</b> - A great HUD. I'm sure everyone by now knows what this HUD looks like. I borrowed the ItemEffectMeters from this hud, and a lot of my elements were inspired by this hud.

<b>omnibombulator</b> - For creating huds.tf, and some of the stuff he has posted in the TF.TV hud mod thread was just amazing. 

<b>Knuckles</b> - Providing the crosshairs. Very well done. :)

<b>SolarHUD (Stochast1c)</b> - I borrowed the ChatScheme.res / BaseChat.res from this hud. The class selection in my hud and this hud are a little bit similar, the off classes are separated from the meta classes. I first got this idea from SolarHUD. A great hud.

<b>Hudas Iscariote (redd0t, cirlo, b4stian, Quartz)</b> - Extremely well made hud. Borrowed the class icon font from this hud.

<b>yayahud (yttrium)</b> - I really enjoyed using this hud a couple years ago. I liked it a lot, and so I incorporated some of the stuff I saw in this hud into mine.

<b>PrismHUD (JarateKing)</b> - This hud was really different, and I really liked it. Heavily inspired by this hud as well.

<b>teamfortress.tv HUD mods/HUD Q&A thread</b> - The stuff people have posted in this thread is absolutely amazing. Some of the stuff posted in that thread inspired me quite a bit. I also owe a huge thanks to the people that go on the HUD Q&A thread and answer people's questions about hud editing. I had quite a few and most of them were answered the next hour or day.

<b>truktruk's sub discord</b> - Honestly, I don't think I would have ever finished this or released this if I didn't subscribe to truktruk on Twitch and joined the Discord. Speaking of which, you should check out truktruk on Twitch. http://twitch.tv/truktruk/ Also, many people from this discord helped out with feedback, testing and reporting bugs to me. :)

Changelog
----------

May 25 - Release

May 31 - Added 16:10 support. Made quickplay result dialog wider.

June 2 - Added full MvM support. Essentials should be edited, and the HUD should be usable. Please let me know if I messed something up, I don't play MvM often.

June 3 - New backpack, crafting, and class loadout menus. The hud is not as VTF reliant as much now. This should be able to be used in all resolutions. 4:3 support is coming very soon, seeing as there are very few things I have to fix up. Unfortunately, I had to move the stream panel down by like, 15 pixels. Hopefully it doesn't detract much from the look.
