<font size="24" color="red">it's not done</font>

there are many bugs

probably won't work (or look good) on any resolution other than 16:9

i apologize

this version of my hud is quite far behind. i apologize if the fonts are ugly, i changed them in the new version which hasn't been released yet. still polishing that.
