It's not done.
=======
there are many bugs

probably won't work (or look good) on any resolution other than 16:9

i apologize

this version of my hud is quite far behind. i will update everything when i know everything is how i want it to be. expect a full release near the end of this month / early june

if your fonts dont work go to resource/fonts and install all of the fonts there.
