mkHUD - It's not done
=======
There are a lot of bugs within this hud. Please comment on my profile if you happen to run into any issues using this HUD.

Screenshots

Resolution Support
----------
16:9 - Made on 1920x1080 resolution. Should work fine on other resolutions. There may be slight offsets with other resolutions, however.

16:10 - Not sure

5:6 - Not sure

4:3 - Kind of. Most elements on the right side of the screen get cut off.


This version of my hud is quite far behind. I will update everything when I know everything is how I want it to be. Expect a full release near the end of this month / early June. Even then, I don't expect everything to be bug-free, so please, let me know what bugs there are.

Fonts
------------
If your fonts aren't working, go to mkHUD/resource/fonts, select all > right click > Install. Restart TF2 and you should be able to see the fonts.

Credits

BroeselHUD (feeling and broesel) - Lots of inspiration. I borrowed some elements from the hud as well. Specifically the tournament spectator hud.

ahud (Nokk) - Again, a lot of the stuff I put into my hud was inspired by Nokk's hud. An amazing hud. He also answered a lot of my questions, and I greatly appreciate the help.

cbhud (CoBa) - It sucks that he hasn't updated it, but still a great hud. Some elements in my hud were inspired by this hud.

ToonHUD (Griever) - I borrowed the SourceScheme.res from his hud. I hope you are alright with this. A very well made hud. Again, some elements in my hud were inspired by his.

ompHUD (omp) - A great HUD. I'm sure everyone by now knows what this HUD looks like. I borrowed some of the ItemEffectMeters from this hud, and a lot of my elements were inspired by this hud.

wavesui (extracrspy) - Though I started creating my hud before this hud was posted to TF.TV, I did get some inspiration from him when he posted in the hud mod thread on tf.tv. The colour scheme of my hud was not intentionally made to be so close to wavesui, but I had to mention this hud. It's so good.

Knuckles - Providing the crosshairs. Very well done. :)

SolarHUD (Stochast1c) - I borrowed the ChatScheme.res / BaseChat.res from this hud. The class selection in my hud and this hud are a little bit similar, the off classes are separated from the meta classes. I first got this idea from SolarHUD. A great hud.

Hudas Iscariote (redd0t, cirlo, b4stian, Quartz) - Extremely well made hud. Borrowed the class icon font from this hud.

yayahud (yttrium) - I really enjoyed using this hud a couple years ago. I liked it a lot, and so I incorporated some of the stuff I saw in this hud into mine.

PrismHUD (JarateKing) - This hud was really different, and I really liked it. Heavily inspired by this hud as well.

MaterialHUD (Rawrsor) - Although it's not completely done yet, a lot of the elements in my hud were inspired by his. The material dropshadows, etc. I used his .vtf files as well (Shadows and the blurfact). He answered the questions I had about hud editing as well. :)

teamfortress.tv HUD mods/HUD Q&A thread - The stuff people have posted in this thread is absolutely amazing. Some of the stuff posted in that thread inspired me quite a bit. I also owe a huge thanks to the people that go on the HUD Q&A thread and answer people's questions about hud editing. I had quite a few and most of them were answered the next hour or day.
